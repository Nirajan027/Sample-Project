//Git init,commit,add
Git init --> initialized a new  git local repo
git add index.html -->add git files in staging area 
git status ---> to track record the of committed and uncommitted files 
git add . --> to include all files in staging area 
git commit -m "first commit" --> to records the changes to the file in local repo 
git status --> showed the current working branch and changes not staged for commit, I have commited all files
added a welcome.html file, git add welcome.html //still to be commited //doubtful here 

Branching 
git branch branchname--> create a branch
(git checkout -b fbt> create a new branch named  fbt)
git branch --> check present branches, only master is present 
------
git branch sample-branch --> creates a branch named sample-branch
git checkout sample-branch --> move to the sample-branch 
made chages in welcome.html file 
git add . --> to add all modifed files into staging area (forget to add files in satging area) 
git commit -m "sample-branch first commit" --> commited files in branch (not execute as i forget to add files into staging area)
git add . 
git commit -m "commit in sample branch"-->commit sucesss 
git checkout master --switched to master branch 

CONNECT TO THE REMOTE REPO 
git remote add orign  git@github.com:Nirajan027/Sample-Project.git
git push orign master -->pushed cahnges to remote repo

Push changes to the remote repo 
create a new file home.html 
git add home.html   //truns green
git commit -m "commit home"--> commit the file to local repo
git push orign  master -->pushed changes to remote repo

Pull changes 
edited the usedcommand.txt file directly in remote repo
commit changes 
git pull orign  master-->pulled the changes into local repo

Push branch 
checkout to branch (sample-branch)
made changes in welcome.html
git status -->shows welcome.html as modified 
git add  . --> add changes in staging area
git push -u orign sample-branch 
 

MERGE 
made changes in usedCommands.txt file and home.html file 
add . and commit -m "new changes before merger"

git merge sample-branch

Delete branch 
git branch -d name_of_branch OR git branch -D name_of_branch--> bruteforce 



Do we have to merge whole branch to master or we can merge only a file ?
